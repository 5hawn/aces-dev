## Reference Images ##

Reference, or "golden", images have been provided in order to help you verify 
your implementation of the reference color transformations. Each provided file 
is the output of one of the transforms included with the system. One pictorial, 
one synthetically generated test chart, and one file representative of a film 
scan have been provided.

The reference images can be downloaded individually or as a zip file from:
