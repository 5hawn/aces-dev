A.M.P.A.S. Image Interchange Framework Developer Resources
==========================================================

The Image Interchange Framework is a set of components that facilitates a wide
range of motion picture workflows while eliminating the ambiguity of today's
file formats. The framework is designed to support both "all digital" and
"hybrid film-digital" motion picture workflows.

The basic IIF components are:

* Color encoding and metric specficiations, file format specifications, color transformations, and an open source reference implementation.
* A set of reference images and calibration targets for film scanners and recorders
* Documentation on the architecture and software tools

This toolkit is intended to serve as a distribution mechanism for key components
of the framework including the reference impelmentation, reference images,
software tools, and documentation.
