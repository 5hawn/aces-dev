A.M.P.A.S. Academy Color Encoding System Developer Resources
==========================================================

The Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) is a set of components that facilitates 
a wide range of motion picture workflows while eliminating the ambiguity of 
today's file formats. The framework is designed to support both "all digital" 
and "hybrid film-digital" motion picture workflows.

The basic ACES components are:

* Color encoding and metric specficiations, file format specifications, color transformations, and an open source reference implementation.
* A set of reference images and calibration targets for film scanners and recorders
* Documentation on the architecture and software tools

This toolkit is intended to serve as a distribution mechanism for key components
of the framework including the reference impelmentation, reference images,
software tools, and documentation.
